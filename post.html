            <p>I am applying for Google Summer of Code this year under Debian. I got to know about this programme through my brother, who was selected for GSOC to contribute to a Debian project last year. He really inspired me to apply to GSOC, even though I hate to admit this on Social media :P  GSoC is a great opportunity for students like me, to start contributing to open source softwares under the guidance of mentors. 
              This motivated me to give  my best and apply for this year.</p>

            <p> I decided to work on the project <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2018/Projects/WizardForStudentsAndNewInterns">“Wizard/GUI helping students get started”</a> under Debian. It aimed at developing a Python package and resources which would help the newcomers in the open source community to get the required software setup and tools easily to get started. This project specially interests me as I feel it overcomes the challenges and simplifies the process for students like me face when starting with open source contribution and setting up the environment.</p> 

            <p>To make a meaningful contribution towards this project, I decided to create a concise Python script. This script automates the process of subscribing to relevant Debian mailing list by sending your email and then confirming it through a customised reply by mail. The input would be entered by the user in a PyQt Based GUI application. Initially, I wasn’t aware of technologies such as PyQt, but I overcame this barrier when I started working on it. I feel really motivated to go along with my work on this project. For getting started with GSoC, I would highly recommend reading the article by Daniel Pocock (Debian mentor), since it personally helped me. https://danielpocock.com/getting-selected-for-google-summer-of-code-2016</p>

            <p>The blog explains how one could start contributing to the open source community by creating a github account, making a blog, IRC, mailing lists etc.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">GIT</h3>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">Git is the fundamental requirement for collaborating  on open source projects. It’s a “Distributed Version control” which allows people to work on same project and share the code and everyone knows what changes you have made.</blockquote>

            <p>Initially I was not well versed with Git but during this application period, I learned important concepts by watching youtube videos and reading blogs. It helped me Learn the basic concepts such as repositories, git command prompt, forking, pull requests etc. I also completed a quick 15 minute course on https://try.github.io for learning the command prompts. While learning Git, all the commands and concepts may seem confusing and trivial, but it comes naturally when you start using it for projects.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">PROJECT</h3>

            <p>The initial contribution I made for the project can be divided into 3 parts for better understanding:
             <ul>
               <li>Submitting user email onto the website (“https://lists.debian.org/debian-outreach/”)</li>
               <li>Confirming Subscription through a mail reply</li>
               <li>Making a Python GUI for the above tasks</li>
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Submitting user email on the website</h2>
            <p>To subscribe to the mailing list,  I tried to enter my email on the website “https://lists.debian.org/debian-outreach/” and clicked on the subscribe button through a python script.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
